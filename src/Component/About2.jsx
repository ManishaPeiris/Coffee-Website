        <p>
          Long before Ceylon became world-renowned for tea, Sri Lanka had a thriving coffee industry.
          In the early 1800s, during British colonial rule, coffee was introduced to the island’s central highlands
          — from Kandy to Nuwara Eliya — where the cool climate and rich soil created the perfect environment for cultivation.
